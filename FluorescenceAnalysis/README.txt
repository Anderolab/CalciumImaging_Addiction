FLUORESCENCE AND BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS:

This folder contains three main functions for analyzing and comparing fluorescence traces (from calcium imaging) with behavioral events.

1. correlateFluorescenceWithBehavior_synchronized

This function aligns the fluorescence traces from each recording of a session with the corresponding behavioral event vectors. Its main goal is to visualize how many (and which) behavioral events fall within the temporal window of the calcium recordings.

Usage:
	Load the experiment structure (usually named Experiment or similar).
	
	Run the function: correlateFluorescenceWithBehavior_synchronized(Experiment)
	
	Select session, events, and recordings in the three GUI windows that appear:
		-First GUI: choose the session.
		-Second GUI: choose the events to observe.
		-Third GUI: choose the recordings to visualize within the session.
		-Select the good_neurons file in the file explorer window that appears (this file is created by previous scripts that filter out false neurons).
		You can select multiple sessions, events, and recordings simultaneously.
	Output:
		A set of graphs for each recording, showing:
		-The global fluorescence trace (mean of all neurons).
		-The behavioral events marked on the trace.

2. correlateFluorescenceWithBehavior_synchronized_means

This function works similarly to correlateFluorescenceWithBehavior_synchronized but focuses on generating comparisons between different sessions. It calculates the average fluorescence in the ±1 second window around each behavioral event, as well as the fluorescence values in the 10 seconds following each event.

Usage:
	Load the experiment structure.

	Run the function: correlateFluorescenceWithBehavior_synchronized_means(Experiment)

	Select session, events, and recordings in the same GUI sequence as in the previous function.

	Objective:
		-Compare fluorescence values centered on behavioral events in early vs. late sessions of the paradigm.
		-Visualize the average fluorescence in a ±1 second window around the event.
		-Compare fluorescence in the 10 seconds following each event across sessions.
	Output:
		-A bar graph with individual data points showing the fluorescence at the chosen event among the selected sessions.
		-An Excel file named fluorescencia_sesiones containing:
			-The fluorescence values per session for each event centered in the ±1 second window.
			-The individual fluorescence values for the 10 seconds after each event.
			-The average fluorescence of all these individual events.
3. plotMeanFluorescenceByRecording

This function generates a comparison graph among recordings rather than sessions. It also calculates global averages of fluorescence for the entire recording, regardless of when behavioral events occur.

Usage:
	Load the experiment structure.

	Run the function: plotMeanFluorescenceByRecording(Experiment)

	Select the recordings you wish to compare.

	Output:
		A bar graph comparing all selected recordings, displaying the global average fluorescence per recording.

Additional Notes:

	-Ensure you have a valid Experiment structure loaded before running any of these functions.
	-Make sure to select the appropriate good_neurons file to include only valid neurons in the analysis.
	-The Excel file (fluorescencia_sesiones) generated by the second function can be used for further statistical analysis.
